An R package for ChIA-PET data analysis

This package provides methods for linker splitting, tag pair counting, normalization and detection of specific interactions for ChIA-PET data. It is based primarily on the statistical methods in the edgeR package. Readers are directed to peruse the user's guide (found in package/inst/doc) to understand the theory behind the pipeline. Installation can be performed by cloning this repository and typing "R CMD INSTALL --build package" on the command line, provided R is installed somewhere.
